Machine Learning (Linear Regression) Projects 01
# Python machine learning (ML) Project: Linear Regression
This project reflects my work on linear regression used in Python with NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and scikit-learn. It analyzes the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales, using the dataset found in An Introduction to Statistical Learning.
# Project Goal:
•	Predict sales according to advertising budgets used for TV, radio, and newspapers in dataset (Advertising.csv) .
# Techniques applied:
•	Data visualization using scatter plots and regression lines
•	Simple Linear Regression
•	Multiple Linear Regression
•	 Model evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE)
•	Residual analysis
# File: 
•	Project in pdf format: Python_Machine_Learning_(ML)_Linear_Regression_project_01.pdf). It has python code with comments, and plots.
# Tools and Libraries
•	Python 
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Pandas
•	Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
